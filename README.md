# Optimal Partition

## License

This program is a toolbox to solve special versions of the Set Partitioning
Problem, that is the combinatorial optimisation of a decomposable objective
over a set of feasible partitions (defined according to specific algebraic
structures: e.g., hierachies, sets of intervals, graphs). The objectives
are mainly based on information theory, in the perspective of multilevel
analysis of large-scale datasets, and the algorithms are based on dynamic
programming. For details regarding the formal grounds of this work, please
refer to:

Partitioning Algorithm with Applications to Hierarchical and Ordered Sets.
