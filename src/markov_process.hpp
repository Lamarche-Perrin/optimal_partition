 * Optimal Partition is a toolbox to solve special versions of the Set
 * Partitioning Problem, that is the combinatorial optimisation of a
 * decomposable objective over a set of feasible partitions (defined
 * according to specific algebraic structures: e.g., hierachies, sets of
 * intervals, graphs). The objectives are mainly based on information theory,
 * in the perspective of multilevel analysis of large-scale datasets, and the
 * algorithms are based on dynamic programming. For details regarding the
 * formal grounds of this work, please refer to:

 * Robin Lamarche-Perrin, Yves Demazeau and Jean-Marc Vincent. A Generic Set
 * Partitioning Algorithm with Applications to Hierarchical and Ordered Sets.

 * Sciences, Leipzig, Germany, May 2014.
