This program is a toolbox to solve special versions of the Set Partitioning Problem, that is the combinatorial optimisation of a decomposable objective over a set of feasible partitions (defined according to specific algebraic structures\-: e.\-g., hierachies, sets of intervals, graphs). The objectives are mainly based on information theory, in the perspective of multilevel analysis of large-\/scale datasets, and the algorithms are based on dynamic programming. For details regarding the formal grounds of this work, please refer to\-:
